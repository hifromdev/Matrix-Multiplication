# Matrix-Multiplication
This was created in Java as a simple project for AP Computer Science A when we were exploring the concept of 2D Arrays. I always found matrices fascinating and in this class we got assigned to create a calculator to multiply the matrices. Although this program is not as advanced as the other programs I've made, I did thoroughly enjoy the creation of this one.
